Dustin Stone Cybersecurity Profilio 
My Strengths included being persistent, energized or enthusiastic about learning new information and technologies, and excel in environments where I am challenged.

I believe in following standard operating producers or SOP, even if I think the rules or a current rule doesn't make sense, it is not my job to question, it is my job to carry out commands and tasks given to me and enforcer and follow security guidelines and procedures.

What most interests me about cyber security, is that it is a field that is always changing and can never be truly mastered.  My current skills obtained from my life, time in the military, and jobs have given me the strength to face adversity head on.
